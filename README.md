# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Live-Fungus-Dataset
1. Objectives
To analyse and understand the activity occurring on such a massive scale, a relational SQL database is not enough. Such kind of data is well suited to a massively parallel and distributed system like Hadoop. The main objective of this project is to focus on how data generated from Twitter can be mined and utilized by different companies to make targeted, real time and informed decisions about their product that can decrease the disease or to find out the views of people on a specific topic of interest. This can be done by using Hadoop concepts. The given project will focus on how data generated from Twitter can be mined and utilized. There are multiple applications of this project. Companies, Doctors, Politicians, Decision Makers, etc can use this project to understand how effective and penetrative their plans & programs are through sentiment analysis.

7.Conclusion
This study focuses on the application of big data analytics technology in the prevention and control of major public health incidents. First of all, we clarified the definition, characteristics, and prevention difficulties of major public health incidents. To cope with these difficulties, the use of big data is an important means to assist prevention and control in major public health incidents. Governments may make full use of the application of big data in an epidemic situation in all aspects of prevention and control, and they can further improve the epidemic prevention mechanism based on big data analytics. In terms of information collection, data collection platforms for the Internet of Things, mobile devices, navigation and search engines, social media, and large-scale gene banks can be fully established. On the basis of information collection, it is necessary to establish an early warning detection mechanism for big data analytics, e.g., using visual analysis, deep learning, and
forecast line analysis techniques. This may be used as a basis for early warning and forecasting, formulating plans, rapid decision-making, and starting emergency mechanisms.
